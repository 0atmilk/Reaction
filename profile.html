   <li><e href="">T(eye)RD (Testing Reactivity Daily), pronounced "tired", is about keeping track of
    <br>how your brain works throughout the day. If you are all about self improvement
    <br>and knowing thyself, this is an ideal opportunity to learn about how reactive
    <br>you are throughout the day.
    <br></br>
    <br>By testing your reactivity at three seperate times of the day,
    <br>we will help you figure out when you are truly most alert.
    <br></br>
    <br>We measure how fast you react to external stimuli and with this data we deliver you
    <br>a report on your stats and whether you are more of a morning, afternoon or evening
    <br>type of person.
    <br></br>
    <br>Even if you think you're most tired in the morning, it may be your most efficient time!
